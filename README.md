# Autoscaling-Paxos
A Paxos protocol that is capable of scaling dynamically.

## Setup
Compile flags are set in `CMakeLists.txt`. I recommend using CLion as your IDE to take advantage of that.

### Protobuf
Messaging between nodes uses Google's Protobuf. Follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md) to install it on your machine.
